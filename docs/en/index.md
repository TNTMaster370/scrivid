# Scrivid Documentation
This is the outline for the documentation for a Python library project on 
GitHub, [Scrivid](https://github.com/trystyncote/scrivid). The project is 
currently in development, so the documentation *will* be incomplete.

When the project is considered "stable" (after version 0; when the API is will 
not change frequently), this page will be updated to be a proper header, but,
for now, will be intentionally bare.
