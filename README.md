*Scrivid* is a Python package that acts as a wrapper to writing instructions for an animation video.

### Example

TODO: [sv1.0] Add this section.

### Legacy

This project is built on the back-bone of a previous attempt at this exact concept, from the same 
person: *scripted-video*. The name of this project, *Scrivid*, is short-hand for *scripted-video*. 
The original project ran based on an external file with SQL-adjacent syntax. This, however, would 
later raise issues with development, since the project seemed to become a development of a 
specialized programming language. *Scrivid* takes the building blocks of the original project and builds it in a 
new direction.
